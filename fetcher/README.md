# [Exercise: Web Crawler](https://go.dev/tour/concurrency/10)

In this exercise you'll use Go's concurrency features to parallelize a web crawler.

Modify the Crawl function to fetch URLs in parallel without fetching the same URL twice.

Hint: you can keep a cache of the URLs that have been fetched on a map, but maps alone are not safe for concurrent use!
